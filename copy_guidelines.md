## Purpose of This Guide

This style guide is presented in the hope that content in the series will feel like a cohesive set of articles. Where
tone or voice differ too broadly from one article to the next, the reader may feel jarred. Consistency in style is
essential.

That said, every person's writing will be unique â€” and we clearly want this to be the case, too! The whole point of this
collection of content is that it's contributed from a wide variety of people; it should feel that way. *The intention of
this guide is to give content a feeling of cohesion, without limiting it so that articles can't speak with their authors'
unique voices.*

## Literary Voice

Speaking of voice.

> A particular style or way of writing that expresses a certain tone or feeling.

This is the literary definition [on Wikipedia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/voice) for voice.
The feeling we are looking to communicate is one where the readers have a sense that the authors are intelligent,
thoughtful people, but who communicate clearly enough for an ordinary person to *relate** perfectly well.

*Our intention is* expressly *not to communicate with the hard-to-parse voice typical of academic literature.*

This style guide aims to be an example of this. For example, the academic writer aiming to flex their intellectual
muscles could write that our intention is not to communicate [abstrusely](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/abstruse). This
isn't a helpful definition! In general, trying to write with the difficulty of the Simple English Wikipedia is a great
start. For reference, [here's the Simple English entry on Wikipedia for black holes](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole).

## Grammatical Voice

A part of writing for the collection in a manner which is simple enough to understand is the grammatical aspect of
voice, which can be active or passive. Contrasts taken from [this writing guide](https://webapps.towson.edu/ows/activepass.htm**:

*Active Voice*:

> At each concert, the soprano sang at least one tune from a well-known opera.

*Passive Voice*:

> At each concert, at least one tune from a well-known opera was sung by the soprano"

Typically, the active voice is easier to understand than the passive. We should try to use that where possible.


## Tonal Variations

The tone of your article should be more or less that which you'd use to describe your experience to a stranger. In
particular:

* Assume no academic background
* A friendly, but relaxed air
* No cursing!

Something which might help to get the right feeling across is to bear in mind the line from Mary Schmich's essay, often
titled "Wear Sunscreen":

> Advice is a form of nostalgia. dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting
> over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth

Only in this case, we are writing for an audience who are *expressly* looking for this advice. Writing with an awareness
that we are drawing on memories, fond or not so, to help inform readers looking to make an important choice and needing
help to do so, can help to frame what we are doing. 

Our intention should be to *lean into this nostalgia*, to be honest about the fact that we are drawing from memories
specific to our experience, and to be humble about the relative importance of what we're relating to the audience.

## Examples

You can check out Tom's entry [here]() for an example of the style we're looking for. This style guide will be kept up
to date as the project moves forward, and the example entry will be updated too to reflect these changes.
